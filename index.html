        <h3>Problem solving, transforming data into knowledge and ideas into products</h3>
        <p>I solve problems. I listen to the wants and what ifs of practicioners in various
          industries and develop solutions to make their work easier, smarter, faster and 
          more accurate. My specialties involve using technology to improve processes and 
          applying techniques from data analysis, data science, data engineering and statistics 
          to throw a life preserver to those drowning in data. 
        </p>

        <h3>Being unconventional is an asset</h3>
        <p>Unconventional. It sounds scary to most people. I specialize in creating
          solutions from brainstorming and developing concepts to turning ideas that
          seemed improbable at into reality. Sometimes an outsider or unconventional
          point of view is needed to convert an idea into a product. 
        </p>
        <p>My experience is diverse. I draw on experience and training in math, science, 
          programming, art, politics, history, the military, entrepreneurship, teaching and 
          mentorship to create solutions in a variety of domains. As a lifelong student
          I will always have an understanding of and ability to learn modern, relevant skills
          and tools to best serve my clients.
